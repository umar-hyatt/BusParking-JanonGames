Thank you for purchasing the Extreme Civilian Character Pack!

You are free to use the models in your own project in any way you like. 
However it is recommended to use them as background characters .


We've included a testing script with 5 animations: 3 Idle-loops, 1 Walk-loop and 1 Sprint-loop.

Use these or apply custom animations on the characters using Mecanim.
